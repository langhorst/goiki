GOIKI
=====

**NOTE:** This project is in the earliest stages possible and is my first foray into the Go language.

Goiki is a git-powered wiki written in Golang. It incorporates Markdown for syntax (with extras) and uses Go templates for flexibility in look and feel.

Why? Because I wanted a stand-alone executable that would run on a Raspberry Pi to serve as a home documentation server.
